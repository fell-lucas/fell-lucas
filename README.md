# Hello, welcome to my GitHub.

I'm a senior software engineer always tinkering with new and upcoming technologies. I have a strong background in Flutter, Nodejs, TypeScript, Nestjs, and I'm always eager to learn and experiment with whatever is new in my area.

## 🔭 What I'm currently working on

- Building a [SaaS platform](https://extensipro.com/en-US/activities) for university professors and students alike about outreach activities. I plan to monetize this in the future, which is why the project is currently closed source. Let me know if you would like a tour on it, and I'm happy to guide you through the source code. It started as a [React/Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) project and was later rewritten in [Svelte/SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/). It uses [Turso](https://turso.tech/) as it's database and is deployed globally as a [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) application.
- Employed by BMW to work full-stack on their customer app, [MyBMW](https://flutter.dev/showcase/bmw).

## 🌱 What I'm studying

- Astro to build my blog
- TypeScript to improve my writing abilities across different frameworks and web technologies
- SvelteKit to build my educational SaaS platform
- Nodejs best practices
